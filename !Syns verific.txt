Q's:

* 2:68 LABELS seem wrong. topic name "to regard?" for l6 is wrong.

* in s24 article change ref: 2:107 is correct reference not 2:108 for s24. 

* in p54 article, give better title: "To create" nstead of giving birth

* minor. article dd2. has question/comment in it. get clarified. (ayah 2:138 for the topic: To drown, dip (id: dd2))
.........................................

* in article SA1, remove the heading.. SAAD. adds no benefit. see ayah 3:141 for the topic: To cleanse, wipe (id: SA1)

* general: 
	- remove .to spurious hyperlinks.
	- remove the margin spacings all around.
	- remove the odd colors, fonts etc.

* minor. seems to be no entry for sawm/fast. Near Synonyms found in ayah 9:112 for the topic: Fasting person (id: r16)	



===============================================================
Verification: Asbab un Nuzul - Juzz 3amma

* Seems like asbab in same sura are somewhat clubbed together; 
	- see asbab for [83:1]. it has asbab for next verse too looks like.
	- see asbab for [92:5-6] -- writeup has mention of asbab for [92:19-21].

Bugs/change requests:
* page numbers come in middle of topic and interrupt flow
* reflow the text so we dont see horizontal scrollbar
* name references are extremely long and distracting
----
* would like to see surah name on top and ayah
* would like to see links to prev and next asbab entry
* would like to see how many asbabs in current page and in current surah
* would like to see listing of all asbabs and ability to see the content on the right.

-------------- end of last page ---------
Lesson learnt: anywhere where we have range of ayah is where we see this problem mostly.
Lesson learnt: highlighting the surah we are currently on ex: 114: throughtout the topic page seems to help in locating word fast.

Topic name mismatch?
*			ayah 84:14 for the topic: To stroll, to wander (id: p34). article heading is 'to turn oneself. phirna'
*			ayah 89:22 for the topic: Congruence (id: h10). congruence vs. [to have mutual understanding]


Topics duplicated or what??
* 79:42: When; To write; 79:42 for the topic: To write (id: l9). 79:42 for the topic: When (id: k9).
* ayah 99:1 for the topic: Wood (id: l8). ayah 99:1 for the topic: To tremble, shiver (id: k8). wood (seems missing) and to tremble/shiver


Invalid links:
* p48: link to .it


Bugs/change requests:
* when click next page, it should scroll to top of div; right now it remains stuck where last scrolling left off.
* when click a topic name, hide the current iframe; show spinning wheel; then show new topic; and might want to reset scrollbar to top.
* when showing topic, add a cache busting param to it.. ?v=5555. else it will show old cached value.


===============================================================
